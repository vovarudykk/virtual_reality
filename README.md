Surface of Revolution “Pear”
TR-23mp, Rudyk Volodymyr
Surface from previuos credit module, when I was variant #18

Requirements
A person wants to use the phone as a tangible device. Develop the application that renders the surface on the screen and performs surface rotation mimicking smart phone orientation in space.
As a laptop/pc does not usually has orientation sensors on board it is suggested to deploy a server (e.g. using node.js Express or a web based server) to deliver your pages to a smartphone.

Variant #16: Implement surface rotation based on software orientation sensor readings.
